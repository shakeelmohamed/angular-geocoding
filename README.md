# angular-geocoding-demo
A simple demo showing how to get geolocation from an address string, also known as geocoding.

## Usage

Simply clone the project, and open `index.html` it should just work.

Alternatively, you can see it hosted by [GitHub pages](http://shakeelmohamed.github.io/angular-geocoding-demo)

## Credits

This demo was inspired by a random [Plunker example](http://plnkr.co/edit/6Wg3UZNsJOHLQCmTJPCQ?p=preview) I found.
